# Commit to GitHub after every implementation

**Commit and push all the time**—after every change, fix, or feature implementation.

1. **Stage** changes: `git add <files>` or `git add .` for the full change set.
2. **Commit** with a clear message: `fix(scope): description`, `feat(scope): description`. Reference PLAN.md or ticket when relevant.
3. **Push** to the remote: `git push origin main` (or current branch). If behind, run `git pull --rebase` first.

Do this in the same turn as your edits. Do not leave work uncommitted unless the user explicitly asks you not to commit.
